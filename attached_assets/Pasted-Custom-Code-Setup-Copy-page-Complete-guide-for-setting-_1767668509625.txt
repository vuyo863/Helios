Complete guide for setting up OneSignal Web Push notifications using custom code integration. Configure JavaScript SDK, service workers, and Safari certificates for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other web browsers.

Only use this Custom Code setup if you need advanced configuration or programmatic control. For most users, we recommend the:
Typical Web Push Setup
WordPress Setup
​
Prerequisites
A OneSignal account
A website with HTTPS (required for web push notifications)
Access to modify your website’s HTML and upload files to your server
Basic understanding of JavaScript (helpful but not required)
​
Creating Your OneSignal App
If this is not your first app with OneSignal, click New App/Website. Otherwise, you’ll proceed directly to the setup.

OneSignal dashboard showing the initial app creation screen

Name your app something descriptive (matching your website name is recommended), then select Web from the platform list. Click Next: Configure Your Platform.
Note: You can add additional platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) later in your app’s settings.

​
1. Choose Integration
Select Custom Code. This enables full programmatic control over prompts, timing, and other settings using our JavaScript SDK.
When to choose Custom Code:
Need to customize notification prompts
Want to control when users are prompted
Require advanced segmentation or targeting
Building a single-page application (SPA)

Web configuration options with Custom Code selected

​
2. Site Setup
Configure your basic site information. These settings affect how notifications appear to users.

Site setup form with required fields highlighted

Field	Description	Requirements
SITE NAME	Display name shown in push notifications	Keep it concise and recognizable
SITE URL	Your complete website URL	Must include https:// and match exactly (include www if used)
AUTO RESUBSCRIBE	Automatically resubscribes returning users	Recommended: Helps maintain subscriber count
DEFAULT ICON URL	Icon for prompts and notifications	Square 256x256 pixels, .png/.jpg/.gif format, HTTPS URL required
Common Gotchas:
Site URL must match exactly (with or without www)
Icons must be served over HTTPS
For local testing, see Local Testing Setup
​
3. Advanced Push Settings
​
Safari Web Push Certificate (Optional)
OneSignal provides Safari certificates automatically at no cost. Only enable this if you have existing Safari Web Push certificates you need to use.

Safari certificate upload option for existing certificates

If enabled, upload your Safari Web .p12 Push Certificate and enter the password.
Click Save to continue.
​
4. Upload Service Worker Files
The OneSignal Service Worker is required for push notifications to function. You have two options:
1
Option 1: Create File Manually (Recommended)

Create a new file named OneSignalSDKWorker.js
Add this single line of code:
importScripts("https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDK.sw.js");
Upload the file to your website’s root directory
2
Option 2: Download and Upload

Download the OneSignal SDK files
Unzip the download
Upload OneSignalSDKWorker.js to your server
​
File Hosting Requirements
Default Location: The service worker must be accessible at https://yoursite.com/OneSignalSDKWorker.js
Custom Location: If you need to place the file in a subfolder, see our OneSignal Service Worker Guide for detailed instructions.
Need a custom location? For subfolder placement or migrating from another push provider, follow our OneSignal Service Worker Guide.

Service worker file download interface

Legacy Setup Alert: If your site was set up before November 22, 2021, and you’re currently using two service worker files (OneSignalSDKWorker.js and OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js), continue hosting both files to prevent service worker issues.
New setups only require the single OneSignalSDKWorker.js file.
​
5. Add Code to Your Website
​
Basic Implementation
Add this code to your website’s <head> section. Replace YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID with your actual App ID from the OneSignal dashboard.
<script src="https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDK.page.js" defer></script>
<script>
  window.OneSignalDeferred = window.OneSignalDeferred || [];
  OneSignalDeferred.push(function(OneSignal) {
    OneSignal.init({
      appId: "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID",
      safari_web_id: "YOUR_SAFARI_WEB_ID", // Only needed if using custom Safari certificate
      notifyButton: {
        enable: true, // Shows the OneSignal bell icon
      },
    });
  });
</script>
