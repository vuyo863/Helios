. Upload Service Worker Files
The OneSignal Service Worker is required for push notifications to function. You have two options:
1
Option 1: Create File Manually (Recommended)

Create a new file named OneSignalSDKWorker.js
Add this single line of code:
importScripts("https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDK.sw.js");
Upload the file to your website’s root directory
2
Option 2: Download and Upload

Download the OneSignal SDK files
Unzip the download
Upload OneSignalSDKWorker.js to your server
​
File Hosting Requirements
Default Location: The service worker must be accessible at https://yoursite.com/OneSignalSDKWorker.js
Custom Location: If you need to place the file in a subfolder, see our OneSignal Service Worker Guide for detailed instructions.
Need a custom location? For subfolder placement or migrating from another push provider, follow our OneSignal Service Worker Guide.

Service worker file download interface

Legacy Setup Alert: If your site was set up before November 22, 2021, and you’re currently using two service worker files (OneSignalSDKWorker.js and OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js), continue hosting both files to prevent service worker issues.
New setups only require the single OneSignalSDKWorker.js file.
​
5. Add Code to Your Website
​
Basic Implementation
Add this code to your website’s <head> section. Replace YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID with your actual App ID from the OneSignal dashboard.
<script src="https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDK.page.js" defer></script>
<script>
  window.OneSignalDeferred = window.OneSignalDeferred || [];
  OneSignalDeferred.push(function(OneSignal) {
    OneSignal.init({
      appId: "YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID",
      safari_web_id: "YOUR_SAFARI_WEB_ID", // Only needed if using custom Safari certificate
      notifyButton: {
        enable: true, // Shows the OneSignal bell icon
      },
    });
  });
</script>
